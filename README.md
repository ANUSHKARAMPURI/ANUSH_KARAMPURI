## ðŸŒŸ Projects
- **[A Breast cancer-specific Combinational QSAR Model Development Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches]([https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/bioinformatics/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2023.1328262/full]):** My work involved using regression-based machine learning and deep learning algorithms to develop a QSAR model that establishes a structure-activity relationship between molecular descriptors of drug pairs and their combined biological activity. Utilizing 11 algorithms, we employed the SHAP approach to identify significant descriptors, analyzing 52 breast cancer cell lines with 25 anchor drugs and 51 library drugs. The Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieved an RÂ² of 0.94 and an RMSE of 0.255, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities, highlighting the potential of combinational therapy enhanced by ML and DL techniques in breast cancer treatment.
- **[Exploratory drug discovery in breast cancer: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach to Identify Novel Drug candidates Targeting RTK Signaling]([https://github.com/AnushKarampuri/project-link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010482524005171?via%3Dihub)):** Breast cancer is a complex malignancy that poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its genetic variability. Our study introduces an innovative drug discovery strategy targeting receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, employing a multimodal deep neural network (MM-DNN) based QSAR model that achieved an RÂ² value of 0.917 and an RMSE of 0.312. We sourced structural analogs from the PubChem database and meticulously screened them to identify relevant compounds. Using the MM-DNN model, we predicted the biological activity of these molecules and conducted feature importance analysis, successfully identifying prime drug candidates for RTK signaling pathway proteins. This approach accelerates early drug development by filtering out inactive compounds, offering a promising strategy for combating breast cancer.
- **ResisenseNet: A Hybrid Neural Network Model for Predicting Drug Sensitivity and Repurposing in Breast Cancer:** Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women, with drug resistance driven by transcription factors and mutations presenting significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we developed ResisenseNet, a predictive model for drug sensitivity and resistance that integrates transcription factor expression, genomic markers, drugs, and molecular descriptors. Utilizing a hybrid architecture of 1D-CNN+LSTM and DNN, ResisenseNet achieved impressive validation accuracy of 0.9794 and a loss value of 0.042. The model has been applied to repurpose existing anticancer drugs across 14 different cancers, identifying increased sensitivity in breast cancer for drugs targeting Low-grade Glioma (LGG) and Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Notably, 14 of the predicted sensitive drugs had no prior history of anticancer activity against breast cancer, highlighting novel therapeutic opportunities. ResisenseNet enhances chemotherapy effectiveness by filtering out ineffective compounds and providing valuable insights for improving breast cancer treatment strategies.
